***Automated faucet for distributing ERC20 Tokens***


### Networks

* Kovan

### Tokens

* SingularityNET (AGI)

Vulpem Ventures has set up a faucet service that uses Github user ID retrived via OAuth to store an address where your ERC20 Tokens can be sent to. This allows you to receive up to 1 Kovan AGI every 24 hours and requires you to have a github account.
